  ## Description
  This application is set up for the user to be able to create, delete, and view notes that are made.  The user can give the note a title and text of their desire and the api will provide an unique id and then the entire note is sent to a json file and stored with the rest of the notes that are created.  To view a note the user just needs to click the desired note title on the side and the note information will be brought up.  To delete a note the user just hits the trash icon on the desired note and the note is pulled and deleted from the json file and title list.  To view the web application just go to: (https://mysterious-cliffs-92619.herokuapp.com/).
